"""NPU backend implementation for Mobilint hardware accelerators.

Provides the :class:`MobilintNPUBackend` class which wraps the ``qbruntime``
library to load, configure, and run MXQ models on Mobilint NPU devices.

The backend can host ``N`` :class:`~qbruntime.Model` instances across one or
more :class:`~qbruntime.Accelerator` handles. ``N`` is derived from
``max_batch_size`` and the compiled batch axis ``K`` probed from the first
loaded slot (``N = ceil(max_batch_size / K)``). Slots are distributed across
the unique devices referenced by the canonical target strings in round-robin
order, and per-device accelerators are shared. ``Model.infer`` is blocking, so
callers that want concurrent NPU utilization thread their dispatches across
:meth:`MobilintNPUBackend.infer_slot` calls.

Target-topology fields (``dev_no`` / ``core_mode`` / ``target_cores`` /
``target_clusters``) are accumulated on a :class:`NPUTargetSpecPending`
override log at ``self._pending``. Every per-field setter records its raw
value on the pending log without normalizing; the canonical
:class:`NPUTargetSpec` is materialized lazily on read of :attr:`_spec` (and
cached on ``self._finalized`` until the next setter). This deferral
eliminates both the partial-state race between fields AND the setter-order
race that eager per-setter renormalization forced on the previous design.

Backwards compatibility: for callers written against a single ``Model`` /
``Accelerator`` handle, :attr:`~MobilintNPUBackend.mxq_model` and
:attr:`~MobilintNPUBackend.acc` remain accessible and refer to the first slot.

        This is the authoritative K probe for LLM MXQs — the input shape
